# Blender_idTechX_map

first stages from a Blender script for exporting idTechX maps
based on the quake map exporter from Campbell Barton with a lot of work done by Biel Bestu√© de Luna

still eraly stage alpha

I intend to:

 - export brush data without correct texture placement
 - export surfaces without correct texture placement
 - figure out a way to export with correct texture placement
 - export vertex wheighted data in order to open it with idTech X

 - for Blender map creation there should be another scripts done but this will be for the future or other individuals.
