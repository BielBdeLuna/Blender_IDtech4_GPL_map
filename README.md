# Blender_idTechX_map

first stages from a Blender script for exporting idTechX maps
based on the quake map exporter from Campbell Barton with a lot of work done by Biel Bestu√© de Luna

Version 0.0.3 Alpha

I intend to:

 - export brush data without correct texture placement              0.0.1--DONE
 - export surfaces without correct texture placement                0.0.2--DONE
 - export scaled data                                               0.0.3--DONE
 - export material name                                             0.0.4--DONE
 - export rotated data                                              0.0.6
 - figure out a way to export with correct texture placement        0.1.0
 - export vertex wheighted data in order to open it with idTech X   2.0

 - for Blender map creation there should be another scripts done but this will be for the future or other individuals.
